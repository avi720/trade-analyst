/**
 * P1-C — shared contract for the chat tool-use layer (server-only).
 *
 * Tools are only registered when the in-scope trade set exceeds the inline
 * byte budget (see `context-builder.ts`), which is a Pro-gated situation. The
 * route has already fetched and filter-scoped every in-scope row by then, so
 * executors work over that in-memory array rather than re-querying — no RLS
 * re-check, no extra round-trip, and they unit-test as plain functions.
 *
 * The one exception is free text. `notes` / `didRight` / `wouldChange` are
 * deliberately absent from `CHAT_TRADE_COLUMNS` — a single trade can carry
 * ~12,000 chars across the three, so pulling them for every row would defeat
 * the point. `queryTrades` therefore resolves them lazily, for the ≤150 rows
 * it is about to return, through the `fetchFreeText` callback the route
 * supplies.
